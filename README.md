# cyberProject-scheduleAndMeetingManager

hey everyone my name is dekel 

just a bit about my project:
this project let you make a schedule and book meetings with other users 
this project is usefull because it value your privacy
by keeping your schedule private from others 
if someone would like to have a meeting with you for him to acsess when you are free
  he would send you a request
  you can choose whether you want to book a meeting with him and have him knowing what the ideal time for meeting for limited time
i have seen that in google calander you can see someones schedule without having a personal permission from him

to be continued and updated...
